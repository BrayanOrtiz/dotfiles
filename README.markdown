# Dani's dotfiles

## What is this? What is a dotfile?
These are my dotfiles.

Dotfiles are settings files used by many applications on UNIX-based systems
such as Linux, BSD or OS X. They are called dotfiles because their name starts
by a dot symbol.

This is because UNIX usually hides files whose name starts by a dot when
browsing files. This makes dotfiles non intrusive when user browses some
folders.

## Why do you share this?
1. Why not?
2. Backup: I can mess happy with my computer because I know that I can restore
   my configuration if something goes bad.
3. Sync: I can share the same configuration between all my computers because
   they all use the same dotfiles set.
4. Sharing: somebody may consider this useful for taking some things or even
   for learning new configurations.
